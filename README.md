# APWorldWebsite
A website intended for use by students currently taking AP World History. It aims to present the full content of the course in a digestible way, organized both by time period and geography.

## Long Term Goals:

### Interactive Map
- An interactive map which displays important events across the entire world during a certain time period. Zooming in should have a similar effect to google maps, where the level of detail of the information increases. A slider will control the time period.
### Per-Country Info
- For each country, a separate section which explains its history categorized in several ways, generally combinations of time, theme, and relevance to the AP test
**Example: China 1200-1450**
- Timeline (No Themes) Format (relevance determined by opacity):
  - Paper before this time period
  - 960: Begins, civil service exam grows in size continuously
  - Early Song: Flying money used
  - 11th century: Steel production begins, Champa rice introduced from Vietnam, moveable type from Korea
  - <span style="opacity: 0.6;">1127: Lost territory to the Jin; Southern Song period</span>
  - 1100s-1200s: Gunpowder weaponry starts to take hold
- No Time Format (relevance shown vertically, top elements most important to know):
